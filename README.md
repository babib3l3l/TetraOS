# TetraOS
My first os, made by the that one day i can use it to replace windows (cause i dont like windows) 
my project is for compiled 64x86 CPU and it run on 32x architecture. You can try to compile it to arm64 if you want to test but is not recommanded...

# Compilation
To compile my OS, you need to have i686, there is the link to download it precompilated : [PreCompilated i686](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools/releases)

Juste take the i686 not the 86x64, it's important !

The other tool of the toolchain is inclued with the project
